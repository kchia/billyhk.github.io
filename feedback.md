# Feedback

Congrats on satisfying the project requirements! Here's some feedback for you:

## Code Quality

Is the code well formatted? Are variable and function names semantic and sensible? Is the code easy to read and understand?

- Code is generally well-named, well-commented and contains few style / quality issues. Take a look at the way I've refactored some of your code, and feel free to reach out to me directly if anything does not make sense.
- I think your default tab-width in your VSCode might be a bit off. I'd recommend using 2 spaces for tab width. Take a look at some of the reformatting I did.

## Technical Requirements

How does the project stack up to the requirements for this project? Is the developer making use of the material we've covered in a way that makes sense?

- Your game renders in the browser with no major errors and separates concerns into distinct HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files. Great job incorporating sound effects and delightful animation effects into your game!

## Creativity and Interface

Is the application easy to navigate? Does it work well in every major browser? Is it responsive? Does it incorporate modern UI Themes?

- Your design looks really cool! I thought the overall design was neat. As a next step, consider making your game responsive!

## Functionality

Does the application work without errors or bugs? Does it present a complete app, where every feature is fully implemented in a way that makes sense?

- The application works without errors or bugs. I think your idea to add a timer and keep track of wins are great next steps!

## Presentation

Is there adequate documentation? Is the repository well organized and free of clutter?

- Your readme contains relevant information about the application. I thought the format made a lot of sense and was easy to understand.
